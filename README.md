This is a client plugin for the Siege Engine MMO game engine.

The Siege Engine is an MMO game engine on the Vulkan API written in the Rust language.

This defines types which specify WHERE the player is in the game world,
including Placement, Movement, and Avatar, code for extrapolating

player is attempting to change their movement.
